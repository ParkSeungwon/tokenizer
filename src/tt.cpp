One of the most friendliest staff members I've ever come across in Bengaluru. They were really cooperative and friendly.\n\nWe had ordered Lassi, French Fries, Cheese Pops, Cheese Paratha and some other dishes. The food was good and fresh.\n\nIn a nutshell, Kapoor's Cafe treated us like family, which is rare in any other cafe or restaurant.\n\nAmbience- 5/5\nFood- 3.5/5\nService- 5/5\n\nOVERALL- 4/5\n\nWould definitely like to visit this place again.""), ('Rated 4.0', ""RATED\n  Kapoor's cafe needs no introduction! They have come up with this new branch in another heart of namma Bengaluru. It has Punjabi theme with khat seats. While sitting here you could enjoy the Punjab delicacies with Punjabi/Bollywood songs.\n\nTheir dry fruit lassi is actually overloaded with dry fruits, so if you like that do try it. If you are visiting here do not keep dieting in your mind, as they actually flow butter/Chesse on your items. I tried their cheesey bites & 6 layered Chesse paratha. Both of these items were delight to eat and literally dripping Chesse. I also took panner pakoda but sadly that was slightly dry and plain in taste.\n\nIn the main course, I loved their Ghee Phulkas and Dal Makhni. Even Baigan ka Bharta was delicious too.\n\nI was blown away with the hospitality and love to see it again on my next visit.""), ('Rated 5.0', ""RATED\n  Kapoor's Cafe, Jayanagar, Bangalore\n.\nA brand in its own when it comes to Punjabi food.
